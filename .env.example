# This file serves as an example of environment variables needed by the application.
# When using Doppler, these variables should be configured in your Doppler project.
# Do not commit your actual .env file if you choose to use one for local overrides (though Doppler is preferred).

# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
WEBHOOK_URL=YOUR_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE

# Example for Coinbase API (as shown in secrets.toml.example)
# These would be configured in Doppler directly.
COINBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_COINBASE_API_KEY_HERE
COINBASE_API_SECRET=YOUR_COINBASE_API_SECRET_HERE

# Example for OpenAI API (if used, as suggested in deploy.yml)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE

# Add other environment variables as needed by the application
# For example, if connecting to a database:
# DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string_here

# For CI/CD specific variables (like those used in deploy.yml for Railway/SSH)
# These are typically set as GitHub Secrets and then can be synced to Doppler if needed,
# or used directly in workflows.
# RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_railway_token_here # If deploying to Railway
# SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="your_ssh_private_key_here" # If deploying via SSH to a VPS
# DEPLOY_TARGET=RAILWAY # or VPS
