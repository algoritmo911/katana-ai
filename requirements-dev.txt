pytest
httpx
pytest-asyncio # For testing async FastAPI/httpx code
respx # For mocking HTTPX requests, useful if we were to mock at HTTP level for NLPService
# For now, we'll mock NLPService directly, but respx is good to note.
# We might not need respx if we patch NLPService effectively.
# Let's stick to mocking NLPService for now.
# unittest.mock is part of Python's standard library, so no need to add it.
