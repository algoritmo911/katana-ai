# Sapiens Notes Private

This repository serves as the secure, versioned, and immutable log for all of Katana's operations, as outlined in the Kusanagi-v1.0 directive.

It is the "black box" of the system, containing a record of all actions, decisions, simulations, and states. This is essential for debugging, auditing, and system recovery.

Key features include `KatanaDynamicMonitoring` for structured logs and `StateSnapshots` for system state checkpointing.
