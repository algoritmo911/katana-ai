# Project Katana: System Overview

Project Katana is a personal AI co-pilot, designed as a practical emulation of the "Cortana" concept from the Halo universe. The system is intended to be a deeply integrated cognitive assistant.

The key principles of Katana are:
- Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) by Default
- Radical Transparency
- Survivability and Decentralization
- Pragmatic Emulation, Not Science Fiction

The system architecture is composed of four main parts: `katana-ai` (the core), `neurovault` (the memory), `sapiens_notes_private` (the log), and `n8n-workflows` (the action bus).
