# This file serves as a blueprint for a web API to interact with Katana AI.
# It uses Flask as an example framework. In a real-world scenario,
# this would be a more robust service (e.g., using FastAPI for async operations).

# To run this, you would need to install Flask: pip install Flask

# import requests
# from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# from katana_ai.orchestrator import CognitiveOrchestrator
# from katana_ai.skill_graph import SkillGraph
# from katana_ai.skills.basic_skills import register_basic_skills

# # --- Configuration ---
# # These would be configurable, e.g., via environment variables.
# WHISPER_API_URL = "http://localhost:8080/inference" # Example URL for a Whisper.cpp server
# PIPER_API_URL = "http://localhost:5000/tts" # Example URL for a Piper TTS server

# # --- Initialization ---
# app = Flask(__name__)

# # Initialize the core Katana components
# print("Initializing Katana AI components for API server...")
# skill_graph = SkillGraph()
# register_basic_skills(skill_graph)
# orchestrator = CognitiveOrchestrator(skill_graph)
# print("Katana AI components initialized.")

#     4. Takes the text response from the orchestrator.
