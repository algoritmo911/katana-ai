# Postmortem Report: TST-001 - Test Suite Integrity Failure

**Date:** 2025-09-17

**Authors:** Jules

## 1. Summary

Following the consolidation of the `feat/async-task-queue` and `feat/async-task-queue-1` branches, the `pytest` test suite was rendered completely non-functional. The failure was characterized by two main classes of errors: `SyntaxError` due to unresolved merge conflicts in test files, and `ModuleNotFoundError` due to an improperly configured test environment.

This report identifies the root causes of these failures and proposes preventative measures to ensure system integrity is automatically verified going forward.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1. Incomplete Merge Conflict Resolution

*   **Symptom:** Multiple test files under the `tests/` directory contained unresolved git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), leading to `SyntaxError` during test collection.
*   **Root Cause:** The manual conflict resolution process was incomplete. The focus was placed on the application source code (`katana/`, `main.py`), while the corresponding test files were overlooked. The divergent nature of the two branches, both appearing to be initial commits, created a complex merge scenario that was not handled with sufficient rigor. This is a **process failure**.

### 2.2. Improper Test Environment Configuration

*   **Symptom:** `pytest` failed to discover modules from the application (`katana`, `main`), resulting in `ModuleNotFoundError`.
*   **Root Cause:** The project lacks a standardized configuration for the test environment. The Python import path (`sys.path`) was not correctly configured to include the project's root directory when `pytest` is invoked. This makes running tests dependent on the user's current working directory and manual `PYTHONPATH` manipulation, which is unreliable and error-prone. This is a **configuration and standards failure**.

## 3. Preventative Measures & Action Plan

To prevent a recurrence of this systemic failure, the following protocol, "Zero Trust Verification", is being implemented:

1.  **Test-Driven Repair (TDR):** The test suite will be repaired incrementally, with `pytest` being run after each file is fixed to ensure progressive restoration of trust.
2.  **CI Mandate:** A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) will be established to automate the execution of the full test suite on every push to `feature/*` and `dev` branches. This will provide immediate feedback on the integrity of the codebase.
3.  **Test Configuration as Code:** The `PYTHONPATH` issue will be resolved by adding a `pytest.ini` file to the project root, which will configure `pytest` to always include the project root in the Python path. This makes the test environment setup explicit and repeatable.
4.  **Definition of Done:** The "Certified Complete" standard is now in effect. No task will be considered complete until the CI pipeline passes successfully. This makes automated verification a mandatory gate for all future development.
