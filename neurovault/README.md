# NeuroVault

This repository represents Katana's long-term memory and the user's digital model, as outlined in the Kusanagi-v1.0 directive.

It is a specialized database and vector store, designed as a structured "neural" network of knowledge, not just a simple data warehouse.

Key components include the `VectorStore`, `KnowledgeGraph`, `UserCognitiveModel`, and `MemoryPolicyManager`.
