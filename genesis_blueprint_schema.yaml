# This schema defines the blueprint for a new agent to be generated by the Genesis Agent.
# It specifies the agent's name, its core purpose, the methods it should have,
# and any external Python libraries it depends on.

name: "Example Agent"
purpose: "A brief, one-sentence description of what this agent is designed to do."

# A list of methods that the agent's class should implement.
methods:
  - name: "process_data"
    description: "This method takes raw data, processes it, and returns the result."
    inputs:
      data: "A dictionary containing the raw data to be processed. Example: {'key': 'value'}"
    outputs: "A dictionary with the processed data. Example: {'processed_key': 'processed_value'}"

  - name: "run_analysis"
    description: "Performs a specific analysis on the given parameters."
    inputs:
      param1: "The first parameter for the analysis (string)."
      param2: "The second parameter for the analysis (integer)."
    outputs: "A floating-point number representing the analysis score."

# A list of external Python packages required by this agent.
# These will be used to generate a requirements.txt or to ensure they are installed.
dependencies:
  - "pandas"
  - "numpy"
  - "scikit-learn"
