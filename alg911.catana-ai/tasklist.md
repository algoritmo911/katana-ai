# Katana Task List

This file tracks development tasks and future ideas for the Katana AI Agent.

## Recently Completed (as part of core CLI, Tasking, and Telegram integration)

- [x] Initialize core modules (CLI, task processing, basic agent structure).
- [x] Configure Telegram integration (receiving messages as tasks, preparing for sending responses, implementing basic Telegram commands).
- [ ] Implement full logging system (Covered by new logging system with Python's `logging` module).
- [ ] Develop basic CLI command shell (Covered by `KatanaCLI` implementation).
- [ ] Implement task queue mechanism (Covered by `katana.commands.json` and related methods).
- [ ] Add system status commands to CLI (Covered by `start_katana`, `stop_katana`, `status_katana`).
- [ ] Create unit tests for KatanaCLI (Covered by `test_katana_cli.py`).


## Pending Tasks / Next Steps

- [ ] Implement actual message sending in `send_telegram_message` (currently placeholder, requires configuring `N8N_TELEGRAM_SEND_WEBHOOK_URL`).
- [ ] Thoroughly test the n8n webhook integration for both receiving and sending Telegram messages.
- [ ] Secure sensitive configurations (like webhook URLs) if the agent were to be deployed.
- [ ] Expand unit test coverage for more edge cases and complex interactions.
- [ ] Develop more sophisticated task processing logic beyond simple command dispatch.

## Future Ideas & Refinements

- Implement dream journaling module.
- Develop Sapiens Coin simulator module.
- Refactor task management into a dedicated `task_manager.py` module.
- Explore running Katana as a proper background service managed by the CLI.
- Expand Telegram command set and improve natural language understanding for Telegram input.
- Implement a more robust event system (e.g., pub/sub) beyond the current task queue.
- Further develop the scaffolded modules (`neuro_refueling`, `mind_clearing`) with actual functionality.
- Integrate other planned core modules as outlined in the broader project vision (NAVIREX CORE, FlowShield, etc.).
- Implement more sophisticated state management for `agent_memory_state`.
- Add more detailed error handling and reporting for failed tasks.
