# Constitution for the Katana DAO-Core

# High-level goal for the agent.
# This defines the primary directive for the agent's actions.
goal: "maximize_knowledge_connectivity"

# System constraints.
# The agent must operate within these boundaries.
constraints:
  # System fatigue represents the accumulated operational load on the agent.
  # It's a measure of how much work the agent has been doing recently.
  # The agent should avoid taking on new tasks if its fatigue is too high.
  system_fatigue: "< 0.9"

  # Resource utilization is a measure of how many resources (CPU, memory, etc.)
  # the agent is currently using. The agent should avoid taking on new tasks
  # that would exceed this limit.
  resource_utilization: "< 0.8"

# Goal formulation parameters.
# These parameters are used to guide the goal synthesizer in formulating
# specific, achievable goals.
goal_synthesis:
  # The minimum priority for a goal to be considered for execution.
  min_priority: 0.5

  # The maximum number of goals to be considered at any given time.
  max_goals: 3
