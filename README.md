# Katana AI: The Symbiotic Intelligence Platform

**This project is the implementation of the "Genesis Directive". Its goal is to create a global platform that merges the collective intelligence of 100,000 human specialists with a powerful, autonomous AI core ("Katana") to achieve unprecedented efficiency in problem-solving and innovation.**

For a detailed overview of the vision, architecture, and implementation roadmap, please refer to the primary architecture document: **[GENESIS_PLAN.md](GENESIS_PLAN.md)**.

## Overview

Katana AI is not just a tool; it is an ecosystem. It is designed to function as a symbiotic partnership between human experts and artificial intelligence. The platform is composed of four core subsystems:

*   **"Agora" (Dynamic Task Marketplace):** A decentralized exchange where tasks are valued, claimed, and executed by both human specialists and AI agents.
*   **"Oracle" (Profiling & Assignment System):** A deep profiling engine that understands the skills, strengths, and cognitive states of every specialist to ensure optimal task assignment.
*   **"Hephaestus" (Automated CI/CD/CQ Pipeline):** A highly automated development pipeline featuring AI-powered code review, automated testing, and predictive deployment analysis.
*   **"Athena" (Knowledge & Learning System):** A self-learning system that analyzes all activities within the ecosystem to generate insights, update documentation, and create personalized training for specialists.

## Current State

The project is in the initial phases of development. The current codebase includes a foundational `TaskOrchestrator` and a simulated `BaseAgent`, which serve as the seeds for the "Agora" and "Oracle" systems.

## Getting Started

Development and setup instructions are being consolidated. For now, refer to the `legacy_readme_content` directory for previous setup guides if needed. The primary focus is on building out the core systems as defined in the **[GENESIS_PLAN.md](GENESIS_PLAN.md)**.
