# Example secrets configuration file for Katana AI
#
# Copy this file to secrets.toml and fill in your actual API keys and other secrets.
# IMPORTANT: secrets.toml is (and should be) ignored by Git (see .gitignore).
# Do NOT commit your actual secrets.
#
# When using Doppler, these secrets (e.g., COINBASE_API_KEY, COINBASE_API_SECRET)
# should be configured in your Doppler project. This file then serves as a
# reference for the kinds of secrets the application might use.

[coinbase]
api_key = "your-coinbase-api-key-here" # In Doppler, this might be COINBASE_API_KEY
api_secret = "your-coinbase-api-secret-here" # In Doppler, this might be COINBASE_API_SECRET

# Add other sections for other services as needed
# [another_service]
# api_key = "your-other-service-key" # In Doppler, e.g., ANOTHER_SERVICE_API_KEY
